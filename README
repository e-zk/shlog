usage
-----
plaintext posts are .md files named in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` stored
in the $POSTS_DIR. once converted to html these posts are named the same, but
with a .html extension ('2020-01-01-mypost.md' -> '2020-01-01-mypost.html').
upon updating, the shlog script searches the $POSTS_DIR for any .md files that
do not have a .html counterpart, and converts these posts to HTML.

usage: shlog [i|index] [r|rss] [u|update]

i|index  : generate a posts index page which lists all posts and links to them
           (newest-first).
r|rss    : generate/update the posts rss feed located at $RSS_FEED.
u|update : search $POSTS_DIR for .md files that have not been converted to html
           and convert them.

when not given any arguments shlog defaults to [u|update].
