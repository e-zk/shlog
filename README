USAGE
plaintext posts are .md files named in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` stored
in the $POSTS_DIR. once converted to html these posts are named the same, but
with a .html extension ('2020-01-01-mypost.md' -> '2020-01-01-mypost.html').
upon updating, the shlog script searches the $POSTS_DIR for any .md files that
do not have a .html counterpart, and converts these posts to HTML.

example $SITE_ROOT:

        .                               # $SITE_ROOT
        |- posts/                       # $POSTS_DIR
        |  |- index.html                # list of posts in chronological order
        |  |- 01-01-0001-post.md        # markdown post source
        |  |- 01-01-0001-post.html      # 'compiled' HTML post source
        |- html/                        # dir containing html
        |  |- footer.html               # HTML added to the end of each post
        |  |- head.html                 # HTML <head> added to every post
        |  |- nav.html                  # HTML added to the start of each post
        |  |- posts.html                # HTML added to $POSTS_DIR/index.html
        |- style.css                    # style (not required)
        |- index.html                   # index/homepage (not required)

command-line usage:

        shlog [i|index] [r|rss] [u|update]
        
i|index  : generate a posts index page which lists all posts and links to them
           (newest-first).
r|rss    : generate/update the posts rss feed located at $RSS_FEED.
u|update : search $POSTS_DIR for .md files that have not been converted to html
           and convert them.

when not given any arguments shlog defaults to [u|update].


DEPENDS
* /bin/sh
* BSD `date` command
* lowdown

a default/reference config is included as `shlog.conf.def`.


NON-GOALS
- post tags/categories


PLANS
- better config variable names
- Linux support (due to dependency on BSD `date`)
- idk tbh
- make it usable
